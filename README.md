**How it Works:** Once the game begins, random boxes will begin to appear. Try and click on as many boxes as you can, and make sure you don't exceed the maximum. As you advance, the boxes will appear at an increasing rate. Look out for powerups that can give you specific advantages. See the "How To Play" section in the game to learn more about specific boxes.

**How to Lose:** Exceed the maximum number of boxes allowed.
